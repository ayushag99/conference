        <h2> ABOUT CONFERENCE</h2>
        
        <p>
            International Conference on Engineering Optimization and Data Science (ICEODS-2019) aims to bring together leading academic scientists, researchers and research scholars to exchange and share their experiences and research results Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning. Focused on a cross-industry discussion, the conference will provide a platform to learn proven case studies and success stories across industries and the risks and potential, AI, Machine Learning and Soft Computing. The conference plays role of main axis to bridge the gap between two global knowledge antipodes, the academia and the industry, it also works as pool of information, which in future processed and stored as knowledge into the minds of participants and readers of the proceedings. The Conference will not only take stock of trends and developments at the globally competitive environment. Besides, it will help in sharing of experience and exchange of ideas, which will foster National and international collaborations. The Conference would be of immense benefit to Management, Researchers, Academicians, Industry and participants from Technical Institutes, R & D Organizations and students working in the field of AI.
